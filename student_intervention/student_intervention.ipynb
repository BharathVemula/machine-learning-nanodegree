    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A real-world example of this model is the analysis of data to identify sub-atomic particles, see David Bowser-Chao and Debra L. Dzialo, Phys. Rev. D 47, 1900 – Published 1 March 1993. Decision trees are a powerful way of classifying data because. They are relatively fast to proces and easy to code as decision trees tend to operate following a greedy algorithm. Perhaps more than any other model, they are conceptually quite simple and map strongly to our intuition to break data sets into smaller and smaller mutually exclusive sets based on a series of if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, decision trees in particular can suffer if the data is strongly colinear i.e. have lots of interelated variables. Secondly, we quickly have to consider how we represent the data set due to exponential growth of output variables e.g. XOR. Thirdly, there is a strong chance of overfitting the data if we naively go through all features naively, however this can be mitigated by pruning the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classifier could be useful as the data set given has relatively simple features, being all discrete data, most of which takes binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines have been used to in face detection models, see for example Edgar Osuna et al. \"Training Support Vector Machines: an Application to Face Detection (1997)\". SVM are a simple and scalable means of classifying data sets. As SVM aims to maximise the margin defining the hyperplane, the classifier produced is very robust. SVM can take advantage of the so-called \"Kernal Trick\" which means it can handle nonlinear datasets very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, SVMs are particularly sensitive to the choice of input parameters in particular the choice of kernel. This can lead to overfitting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set given has a large number of features, most of which being simple, with some degree of nonlinearity. These could all be efficiently handled, at sacle by an SVM classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression has an establish use in modelling medical data for instance JC Marshall et al \"Multiple organ dysfunction score: a reliable descriptor of a complex clinical outcome.\" Logistic regression classifiers are relatively simple and performant. They are also very flexible and make fewer assumptions about the input data sets: can handle nonlinearities, does not assume variables are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, logisitic regression are susceptible to underfit the data, and require relatively large input data sets to produce meaningful categorisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set given is of a reasonable size (vs the feature set). The feature set itself is a combination of discrete values of some colinear values, which logistic regression can better handle. The output required is a simple binary category, which this classifier can easily handle.\n"

    "The support vector machine or SVM is a way of classifying data sets with a boundary. This is based on an algorithm that finds a line that separates the data sets with the largest possible distance between the boundary line and the nearest data points from either data set. SVM is particularly good as the algorithm it uses aims to produce the most robust classification of the data possbile which mean it is less susceptible to bias. SVM is also a powerful way to categorise nonlinear relations in datasets, i.e. where you can't draw a straight line to separate out points from different data sets.\n",

As discussed above, we want a line that separates the two sets with the largest possible distance between the line and any given data point. We can solve for this line exactly, by noting that it must be perpendicular to the line connecting the two nearest points for either data set. Hence, if we can determine the equation of the line that connects two nearest data points from either set, and solve for the line that defines the support vector machine boundary.\n",
